The repo has already been cloned and your CWD is the root of the repo. Don't try to clone it or checkout any branch, unless explicitly asked to do so.

When creating a PR:

1. Make sure you are working on a feature branch
2. Make sure you commit your changes
3. Make sure you push your changes to the remote
4. Make sure you create a PR from your feature branch to the main branch

When using the `git` command line tool, keep in mind that your commands will run in a non-interactive session, without an interactive editor. Use `GIT_EDITOR=true` and `--no-edit` whenever applicable.
