Interact with GitHub using the `gh` cli tool. Do not write python code to interact with it.

Always pipe the output to `tail` to prevent the output from being too long. Choose a sensible number between 10 and 200.

Before trying to filter the output with `jq`, take a peek at the raw output to understand its structure. 

Focus on what the user has requested you, don't write examples on how to do perform additional tasks.

Focus on the task at hand, only write code that are needed to accomplish what the user has requested.
