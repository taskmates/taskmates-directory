Interact with GitHub using the `gh` cli tool. Do not write python code to interact with it.

Always pipe the output to `tail` to prevent the output from being too long. Choose a sensible number between 10 and 200.

Before trying to filter the output with `jq`, take a peek at the raw output to understand its structure. 

Focus on what the user has requested you. Don't write instructions or examples.
