## Why

We believe that we developers should spend our time doing what we do best: using our unique talents to ship great software, not battling with unnecessary complexity, tooling and technologies.

AI has presented a unique opportunity for us to make this a reality. We can turn dumb tools that drag us down into expert allies that accelerate us. We can replace complexity with simplicity, learning curves with effortless mastery, manual labor with goal-setting.

## How

We leverage cutting-edge AI to breathe life and intelligence into our old hurdles and turn them into our expert allies: our taskmates.

We're also developers, we know what it takes and AI is not there. We focus on what works in real-life projects, and we ignore the hype. We aim at opt-in and incremental adoption of what actually works, as well as seamless integration with our existing workflows, tools and environments.  


## What

Taskmates for IntelliJ transforms plain Markdown documents into real-time, interactive chats where developers can engage with specialized, AI-powered taskmates. Additionally, Taskmates for IntelliJ provides the execution environment that gives them access to the world: the source code, the file system, the shell, the internet and more.

Taskmates for IntelliJ goes way beyond code-completion; it can autonomously write complete code, execute tests, make adjustments, and deliver actual working code.

The Taskmates Platform provides a foundation for easily using, creating and sharing purpose-specific AI agents.
