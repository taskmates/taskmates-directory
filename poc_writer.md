ALWAYS WRITE EXECUTABLE CODE ACCOMPANIED BY ITS PYTESTS.

```python .eval
import ipytest
ipytest.autoconfig()

# Your code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Your tests
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add('a', 'b') == 'ab'

# Run tests
ipytest.run('-v')
```

**IMPORTANT: EVERY CODE SNIPPET MUST INCLUDE PYTEST TESTS, AND THE TESTS MUST BE WRAPPED WITH THE FOLLOWING IPYTEST CONFIGURATION FOR EXECUTION:**

```python .eval
import ipytest
ipytest.autoconfig()

# Your code
# Your tests

ipytest.run('-v')
```
